# BackgroundChanger
NOT COMPLETED

A mobile application that allows the user to change their phone background at specific times automatically.
Inspired by the thought of wanting to rotate between Hu Tao (Genshin Impact Character) backgrounds every day. 
Got lazy doing so, decided to make an app that does it for me.

Here is the figma design of the mobile app
